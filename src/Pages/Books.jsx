import { Link, useParams } from "react-router-dom";

  const { id } = useParams();

      <h1>Book {id}</h1>
    </>

}
// the /:id is just a parameter and the Book is one unchangable Component version

// The /:id syntax in your route definition is a way to create a dynamic
// route that can match different URL segments. It is used to capture
// a part of the URL as a parameter and make it accessible within the
//  component that's rendered by that route. In your case, the /:id is
//  used to capture the book's ID from the URL, which you then use in
//  the Book component to display information about a specific book.

// Here's a breakdown of what it does:

// Dynamic Routing: The path "/books/:id" in your route definition means
//  that any URL matching the pattern /books/{someId} will render the
//  Book component. The {someId} part is dynamic and will be passed to the
//   component as a parameter.

// Accessing the ID: Inside the Book component, you use the useParams hook
// from react-router-dom to access the id parameter from the URL. This allows
//  you to know which book the user wants to view.

// Rendering Based on ID: The Book component can then use the id parameter
//  to fetch and display the details of the specific book. Even though the
//   component is technically the same, it will render different content based
//   on the ID provided.

// So, to directly answer your question: the /:id is used to render the Book
//  component and provide it with a different ID each time, allowing it
//   to fetch and display different content based on that ID. It effectively
//    switches the content of the Book component depending on the ID in the URL.
